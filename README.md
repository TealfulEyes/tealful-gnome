# Tealful-Gnome

## A GNOME Desktop Environment theme.

Currently a work in progress as I dig through various parts of the GNOME desktop environment. Everything is split into SCSS if you wish to make further changes yourself in a easier fashion.
I recommend using SASS to manage the CSS for this, but you're free to edit the gnome-shell.css file as well. 

Instructions for newer Linux users on how to use the theme will be made later as well

**NOTE:** This is created with GNOME 46, but should be compatible with older versions too.
